3. Install the required packages with pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the application using: `uvicorn server.route:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5656`
5. App shall run in `http://localhost:5656/`

## Features

- Natural language query processing
- Direct query execution and result display
- Context-aware schema understanding
- Modular plug-and-play architecture

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 - Core Implementation
- [x] Basic application setup with Llama 3.1 integration
- [x] Word-to-query execution system
- [x] Direct result display implementation

### Phase 2 - Enhanced Features
- [ ] Testing and benchmarking on different models like `sqlcoder` [wip]
- [ ] Improved schema context understanding [wip]
- [ ] Cache db tables and schema [wip]
- [ ] Understanding user intent to execution (query, results, analysis)[wip]
- [ ] Memory
- [ ] Planning Mode
- [ ] Choose between installed models from ui
- [x] user can modify the query from ui
- [x] update/delete query gaurdrailing
- [ ] Remembering chat context
- [ ] Advanced result visualization
- [ ] Human intervention if required.

### Phase 3 - UI
- [ ] A user can describe the schema of the database from ui.
- [ ] Migrate to Next.js
- [ ] New Chat UI
- [ ] Store old chat history to prevent re-execution of queries.

### Phase 4 - Architecture
- [ ] Plug-and-play component system
- [ ] Modular extension support
- [ ] API integration capabilities
